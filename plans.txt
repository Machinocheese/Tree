Day 1:
Drafted a basic Object structure for a Tree, looked at a couple of Javascript supersets.

Day 2:
Write your own basic animations - main ones include vertical down.
These are just prototypes for more complex animations like a leaf drifting down.

Very useful reference:

Example code is in app.ts.

I managed to get canvas to be max screen size, but I ended up struggling most of the day with the Typescript inheritance syntax.
The end result is that I got something semi-working (I think), but I still have work to do in terms of animation.
The requestAnimationFrame() method is going wrong...

Day 3:
Get animation working, and see if you can read in information properly from the Tree object/class.

Animation didn't update, however, I did manage to set up the inheritance as well as obtain solid art direction in terms
of how I want my tree to ultimately look.
